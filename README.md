# Batches
Various Windows batch files that have served as a means to an end. Or an end to a means?

## MySQL Backup
A batch file to create daily, weekly, and monthly backups of a MySQL database. Original batch file credit goes to Bradford Mitchell for [sharing his backup batch file](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysqldump.html) on the MySQL forums in the comments section for mysqldump. Initial commit is, more or less, Bradford's code.

## A5 Kill
A crude process to restart a set of Alpha5 Application Web Servers. This isn't the way you should handle your web services. You shouldn't use this batch file. Do as I say, not as I do.
